# Amazon Product Review Scraper (Selenium + NLP)

This project is a fully automated Amazon Product Review Scraper that:
- Scrapes product reviews from Amazon using Selenium
- Performs sentiment analysis using Hugging Faceâ€™s `transformers`
- Stores results in SQLite (`amazon_reviews.db`)
- Generates a Word Cloud to visualize the most common words in reviews

## Features
- Dynamic ASIN Input: Enter any Amazon ASIN to scrape its reviews
- Bot Evasion: Uses real browser interactions to bypass Amazon detection
- Sentiment Analysis (AI/ML): Classifies reviews as Positive, Negative, or Neutral
- Data Storage: Saves extracted reviews into an SQLite database
- Word Cloud Visualization: Highlights frequently mentioned words
